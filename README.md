*DESCRIPTION*
***TASK2-SPEECH RECOGNITION SYSTEM***
Building a basic speech-to-text system using pre-trained models and libraries like SpeechRecognition or Wav2Vec involves several steps:

## Key Components
- *Acoustic Model*: Converts audio signals into phonetic units.
- *Language Model*: Predicts the probability of word sequences.
- *Decoder*: Combines outputs from the acoustic and language models to generate text.

## Step-by-Step Guide
1. *Install Required Libraries*: Install libraries like `SpeechRecognition`, `PyAudio`, `torch`, `torchaudio`, and `transformers` using pip.
2. *Load Pre-trained Model*: Load a pre-trained Wav2Vec2 model using `transformers` library, such as `facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h`.
3. *Prepare Audio Data*: Load and preprocess audio files, ensuring 16 kHz sample rate and correct formatting.
4. *Extract Features*: Use `Wav2Vec2Processor` to extract features from audio data.
5. *Fine-tune Model*: Fine-tune the pre-trained Wav2Vec2 model on your dataset using `Trainer` from `transformers`.
6. *Evaluate Model*: Compute Word Error Rate (WER) using `jiwer` library to evaluate model performance.
7. *Run Inference*: Use the trained model to transcribe new audio files.

## Popular Libraries and Models
- *Wav2Vec2*: A self-supervised model for speech recognition, available in `transformers` library.
- *SpeechRecognition*: A library for speech recognition, supporting various APIs and models.
- *PyTorch*: A deep learning framework for building and training models.
- *Hugging Face*: A platform providing pre-trained models and libraries for NLP and speech recognition ¹ ² ³.

## Benefits and Applications
- *Virtual Assistants*: Speech-to-text systems power virtual assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa.
- *Transcription Services*: Automated transcription services benefit from speech recognition technology.
- *Accessibility*: Speech-to-text systems enhance accessibility for individuals with disabilities ⁴.
